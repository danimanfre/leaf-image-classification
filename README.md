# leaf-image-classification

This repository is a collection of notebooks and a report describing a deep learning competition organized for the students of the course Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning at Politecnico di Milano. The competition involved classifying images of leaves into different plant species. The goal was to predict the correct class label for a given image.

The competition details and dataset can be found on CodaLab at this link: https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/226.

The repository includes a report that outlines the approach taken by my team called "Polimi Dropouts." It describes our workflow, the challenges we faced, how we addressed some of those challenges, and provides insights into our best models. The report explains the rationale behind our model choices and presents the results we achieved.

The notebooks in the repository implement some of the team's most successful models named MarkZuckerberg, SteveJobs, and BillGates. Additionally, there is a notebook called BalanceData that contains the code used for data preprocessing.

When running the notebooks, be cautious as the folder paths may vary due to different environments. Make sure to adjust the folder paths according to your system. The team primarily used Google Colab with Google Drive.
